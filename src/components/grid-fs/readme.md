# gx-grid-fs

A container for including a repetitive elements list.
It provides 3 slots:

- `'grid-content'` slot: This slot holds the grid's content
- 'grid-content-empty' slot: This slot will be shown only when the grid is empty.
- 'grid-loading-content': This slot will be shown while the grid is being loaded. Include the loading indicator markup here.

When the grid is empty, a CSS Class named 'gx-grid-empty' is added to the host element.
When the grid is loading, a CSS Class named 'gx-grid-loading' is added to the host element.

| `threshold`     | `threshold`      | The threshold distance from the bottom of the content to call the `infinite` output event when scrolled. The threshold value can be either a percent, or in pixels. For example, use the value of `10%` for the `infinite` output event to get called when the user has scrolled 10% from the bottom of the page. Use the value `100px` when the scroll is within 100 pixels from the bottom of the page.                                                                                         | `string`                     | `"150px"`    |
