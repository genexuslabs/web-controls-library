# gx-grid-flex

A container for including a repetitive elements list based on Flex layout
It provides 3 slots:

- 'grid-content' slot: This slot holds the grid's content
- 'grid-content-empty' slot: This slot will be shown only when the grid is empty.
- 'grid-loading-content': This slot will be shown while the grid is being loaded. Include the loading indicator markup here.

When the grid is empty, a CSS Class named 'gx-grid-empty' is added to the host element.
When the grid is loading, a CSS Class named 'gx-grid-loading' is added to the host element.

## Example

<gx-grid-flex>
    <div slot="grid-content">
        <div class="item">ROW1</div>
        <div class="item">ROW2</div>
    </div>
</gx-grid-flex>

| `alignContent`   | `align-content`   | This aligns a flex containerâ€™s lines within when there is extra space in the cross-axis, similar to how justify-content aligns individual items within the main-axis. \| Value \| Details \| \| --------------- \| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \| \| `center` \| Lines are packed toward the center of the flex container. \| \| `flex-end` \| Lines are packed toward the start of the flex container. \| \| `flex-start` \| Lines are packed toward the end of the flex container. \| \| `space-around` \| Lines are evenly distributed in the flex container, with half-size spaces on either end. \| \| `space-between` \| Lines are evenly distributed in the flex container. \| \| `stretch` \| Lines stretch to take up the remaining space. \|                                                                                                                                                                                                       | `"center" \| "flex-end" \| "flex-start" \| "space-around" \| "space-between" \| "stretch"`      | `DEFAULT_ALIGN_CONTENT`   |
| `alignItems`     | `align-items`     | This attribute lets you define the default behavior for how flex items are laid out along the cross axis on the current line. Think of it as the justify-content version for the cross-axis (perpendicular to the main-axis). \| Value \| Details \| \| --------------- \| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ \| \| `baseline` \| Controls are aligned such as their baselines align. This is useful to have several texts from different controls aligned taking into account different font sizes. \| \| `center` \| Controls are positioned at the center of the container. \| \| `flex-end` \| Controls are positioned at the end of the container. \| \| `flex-start` \| Controls are positioned at the beginning of the container. \| \| `stretch` \| Controls are stretched to fit the container. In other words, children match the size of their container in the cross axis. \| | `"baseline" \| "center" \| "flex-end" \| "flex-start" \| "stretch"`                             | `DEFAULT_ALIGN_ITEMS`     |
| `autoGrow`       | `auto-grow`       | This attribute defines if the control size will grow automatically, to adjust to its content size.

| `flexWrap`       | `flex-wrap`       | Determine whether the flex container is single-line or multi-line, and the direction of the cross axis. This attribute specifies what happens when children overflow the size of the container along the main-axis of the layout container. By default, flex items will all try to fit onto one line. You can change that and allow the items to wrap as needed with this attribute. \| Value \| Details \| \| -------------- \| ------------------------------------------------------------- \| \| `nowrap` \| All flex items will be on one line \| \| `wrap` \| Flex items will wrap onto multiple lines, from top to bottom. \| \| `wrap-reverse` \| Flex items will wrap onto multiple lines from bottom to top. \|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | `"nowrap" \| "wrap" \| "wrap-reverse"`                                                          | `DEFAULT_FLEX_WRAP`       |
| `invisibleMode`  | `invisible-mode`  | This attribute lets you specify how this element will behave when hidden. \| Value \| Details \| \| ------------ \| --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \| \| `keep-space` \| The element remains in the document flow, and it does occupy space. \| \| `collapse` \| The element is removed form the document flow, and it doesn't occupy space. \|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | `"collapse" \| "keep-space"`                                                                    | `"collapse"`              |
| `justifyContent` | `justify-content` | This attribute lets you define the alignment along the main axis. It helps distribute extra free space leftover when either all the flex items on a line are inflexible, or are flexible but have reached their maximum size. It also exerts some control over the alignment of items when they overflow the line. \| Value \| Details \| \| --------------- \| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ \| \| `center` \| Controls are positioned at the center of the container. \| \| `flex-end` \| Controls are positioned at the end of the container. \| \| `flex-start` \| Controls are positioned at the beginning of the container. \| \| `space-around` \| Controls are positioned with space before, between, and after the lines. \| \| `space-between` \| Controls are positioned with space between the lines. \| \| `space-evenly` \| Controls are positioned with space evenly around them. \|                                                                            | `"center" \| "flex-end" \| "flex-start" \| "space-around" \| "space-between" \| "space-evenly"` | `DEFAULT_JUSTIFY_CONTENT` |
| `loadingState`   | `loading-state`   | Grid loading State. It's purpose is to know rather the Grid Loading animation or the Grid Empty placeholder should be shown. \| Value \| Details \| \| ---------- \| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ \| \| `loading` \| The grid is waiting the server for the grid data. Grid loading mask will be shown. \| \| `loaded` \| The grid data has been loaded. If the grid has no records, the empty place holder will be shown. \|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | `"loaded" \| "loading"`                                                                         | `undefined`               |
| `recordCount`    | `record-count`    | Grid current row count. This property is used in order to be able to re-render the Grid every time the Grid data changes. If not specified, then grid empty and loading placeholders may not work correctly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | `number`                                                                                        | `undefined`               |
| `threshold`      | `threshold`       | The threshold distance from the bottom of the content to call the `infinite` output event when scrolled. The threshold value can be either a percent, or in pixels. For example, use the value of `10%` for the `infinite` output event to get called when the user has scrolled 10% from the bottom of the page. Use the value `100px` when the scroll is within 100 pixels from the bottom of the page.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | `string`                                                                                        | `"150px"`                 |

| `--gx-grid-flex-align-content`   | This aligns a flex containerâ€™s lines within when there is extra space in the cross-axis, similar to how justify-content aligns individual items within the main-axis. \| Value \| Details \| \| --------------- \| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \| \| `center` \| Lines are packed toward the center of the flex container. \| \| `flex-end` \| Lines are packed toward the start of the flex container. \| \| `flex-start` \| Lines are packed toward the end of the flex container. \| \| `space-around` \| Lines are evenly distributed in the flex container, with half-size spaces on either end. \| \| `space-between` \| Lines are evenly distributed in the flex container. \| \| `stretch` \| Lines stretch to take up the remaining space. \|                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `--gx-grid-flex-align-items`     | This defines lets you define the default behavior for how flex items are laid out along the cross axis on the current line. Think of it as the justify-content version for the cross-axis (perpendicular to the main-axis). \| Value \| Details \| \| --------------- \| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ \| \| `baseline` \| Controls are aligned such as their baselines align. This is useful to have several texts from different controls aligned taking into account different font sizes. \| \| `center` \| Controls are positioned at the center of the container. \| \| `flex-end` \| Controls are positioned at the end of the container. \| \| `flex-start` \| Controls are positioned at the beginning of the container. \| \| `stretch` \| Controls are stretched to fit the container. In other words, children match the size of their container in the cross axis. \| |
| `--gx-grid-flex-flex-direction`  | Determines the direction of the main-axis (and the cross-axis, perpendicular to the main-axis). The direction children items are placed inside the Flexbox layout. \| Value \| Details \| \| ---------------- \| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \| \| `column` \| Controls are displayed vertically, as a column (from top to bottom). \| \| `column-reverse` \| Controls are displayed vertically, as a column, in reverse order (from bottom to top). \| \| `row` \| Controls are displayed horizontally, as a row (from left to right). \| \| `row-reverse` \| Controls are displayed horizontally, as a row, in reverse order (from right to left). \|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `--gx-grid-flex-flex-wrap`       | Determine whether the flex container is single-line or multi-line, and the direction of the cross axis. This attribute specifies what happens when children overflow the size of the container along the main-axis of the layout container. By default, flex items will all try to fit onto one line. You can change that and allow the items to wrap as needed with this attribute. \| Value \| Details \| \| -------------- \| ------------------------------------------------------------- \| \| `nowrap` \| All flex items will be on one line \| \| `wrap` \| Flex items will wrap onto multiple lines, from top to bottom. \| \| `wrap-reverse` \| Flex items will wrap onto multiple lines from bottom to top. \|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `--gx-grid-flex-justify-content` | This defines lets you define the alignment along the main axis. It helps distribute extra free space leftover when either all the flex items on a line are inflexible, or are flexible but have reached their maximum size. It also exerts some control over the alignment of items when they overflow the line. \| Value \| Details \| \| --------------- \| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ \| \| `center` \| Controls are positioned at the center of the container. \| \| `flex-end` \| Controls are positioned at the end of the container. \| \| `flex-start` \| Controls are positioned at the beginning of the container. \| \| `space-around` \| Controls are positioned with space before, between, and after the lines. \| \| `space-between` \| Controls are positioned with space between the lines. \| \| `space-evenly` \| Controls are positioned with space evenly around them. \|                                                                            |
| `--gx-overflow-style`            | Determine if the overflow will be hidden or visible. By default, the gx-grid-flex hide its content overflow.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
